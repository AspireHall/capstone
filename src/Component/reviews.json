    "review": "I had a lovely dinner at Little Lemon Restaurant last weekend. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, with a charming Mediterranean vibe. I ordered the lemon garlic chicken with roasted vegetables, and it was absolutely delicious—tender, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The staff was friendly and attentive without being overbearing!"

    "review": "Little Lemon exceeded my expectations. From the moment we walked in, the staff was incredibly hospitable. I had the grilled sea bass with lemon herb butter, and it was phenomenal. The ingredients tasted fresh and the flavors were well-balanced. The ambiance was calm and perfect for date night. Highly recommend!"

    "review": "Great experience at Little Lemon! The décor is stylish but not overdone, and the menu had plenty of vegetarian options, which I really appreciated. I had the lemon risotto and a citrus tart for dessert—both were delicious. Service was polite but a bit rushed. Still, I’d go again for the food alone!"
