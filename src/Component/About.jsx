        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to Little Lemon, a cozy neighborhood bistro nestled in the
          heart of Chicago. Founded by two passionate chefs with a love for bold
          Mediterranean flavors, Little Lemon blends the charm of a family-run
          kitchen with the sophistication of modern cuisine. We specialize in
          fresh, seasonal dishes inspired by the sun-soaked coasts of Italy,
          Greece, and southern France â€” all crafted with locally sourced
          ingredients and a whole lot of heart. From zesty lemon chicken to
          handmade pasta and herb-infused flatbreads, every plate tells a story
          of comfort, culture, and creativity. Whether you're stopping by for a
          casual lunch, a romantic dinner, or a celebratory toast with friends,
          Little Lemon is your spot for warm hospitality, vibrant food, and a
          little citrus twist in every experience.
